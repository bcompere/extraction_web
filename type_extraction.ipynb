    "## Extract type facts from a Wikipedia file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### === Purpose ===\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to write an algorithm that extracts the type of an entity by using Wikipedia articles.  \n",
    "The algorithm's input contains both the title and the content of the Wikipedia article. The title is the entity for which we want to extract its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we want to extract the type of the entity Leicester from its corresponding Wikipedia article. The input is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    title: Leicester\n",
    "\n",
    "    content: Leicester is a small city in England\n",
    "    \n",
    "and the goal is to return:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Leicester TAB city\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### === Provided Data ===\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a preprocessed version of the Simple Wikipedia (`wikipedia-first.txt`), which looks like above\n",
    "2. a template for your code, `type_extraction.py`\n",
    "3. a gold standard sample (`gold-standard-sample.tsv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### === Task ===\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `extract_type()` function so that it extracts the type of the article entity from the content.\n",
    "For example, for a content of \"Leicester is a beautiful English city in the UK\", it should return \"city\".\n",
    "Exclude terms that are too abstract (\"member of...\", \"way of...\"), and try to extract exactly the noun.\n",
    "You can also skip articles (e.g. `return None`) if you are not sure or if the text does not contain any type.\n",
    "In order to ensure a fair evaluation, do not use any non-standard Python libraries except `nltk` (`pip install nltk`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "April  \n",
    "April is the fourth month of the year with 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "April TAB month\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### === Development and Testing ===\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a certain number of gold samples for validating your model.\n",
    "Finally, we calculate a F1 score using following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`F1 = (1 + beta * beta) * precision * recall / (beta * beta * precision + recall)`\n",
    "\n",
    "with `beta = 0.5`, putting more weight on precision in that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### === Submission ===\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take your code, any necessary resources to run the code, and the output of your code on the test dataset (no need to put the other datasets!)\n",
    "2. ZIP these files in a file called `firstName_lastName.zip`\n",
    "3. submit it here before the deadline announced during the lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "https://ln5.sync.com/dl/04d8f4540/ezmyuduy-rss32ktt-kx923xbr-ncmnfatt\n",
    "### === Contact ===\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any additional questions, you can send an email to: zacchary.sadeddine@telecom-paris.fr\n"
